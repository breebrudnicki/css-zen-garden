<h1>CSS Zen Garden</h1>
<p>The CSS Zen Garden Project is for developers and designers to truely test their skills and see what they can do with pure CSS.</p> 

<p>The HTML is provided for the project and can be found at the <a href="https://www.csszengarden.com">CSS Zen Garden</a> website, 
and the developer is to go crazy and show off their skill.</p>

pretty neat CSS skills made possible through SCSS.</p>
