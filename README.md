The CSS Zen Garden Project is for developers and designers to truely test their skills and see what they can do with pure CSS. 

The HTML is provided for the project and can be found at csszengarden.com, and the developer is to go crazy and show off their skill. 

Our particular project idea is one that takes the audience through the depths of the sea, diving into the deep and showing off some 
pretty neat CSS skills made possible through SCSS. 

Enjoy!
